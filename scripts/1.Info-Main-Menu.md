# Basics

## Tmux Key Binds !!IMPORTANT!!!
- Tmux is used for the server console.
- Tmux keybinds are wierd, because you need to press 2 keybinds after another:
  **CTRL + B (let go) D**
  - This will exit from the tmux window without stoping the running server. 

## Modrinth Colection ID
- Modrinth colection ID is ment for moded servers and is not manditory.
  - The ID comes from the URL adress, example:
  - https://modrinth.com/collection/ziTsdV9j
  - where the ID is: ziTsdV9j
- Modrinth autodownloader automaticly installs server mods or plugins.
  - You need to enter a colection ID for it to work
