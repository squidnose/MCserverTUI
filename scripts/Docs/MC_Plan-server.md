# How to plan a Minecraft (MC) Server
- The questions you need to ask yourself before making a Minecraft server

## Player Count
- Do you want to play with friends?
- Do you want to play alone?

## Play from where?
- Do you wish to access the server from anywhere in the world?
- Do you want only local access on your home network?

## Version and Mods
- Do you want to use the newest version?
- Do you want to use a specific version?
- Do you want to use mods?
    - And if so, how many of them?
    
## Memory amount
- A good calculator for how much ram you will need: https://mcserverjars.com/guides/ram-calculator
- The calculations are not precise!

## Hosting
- Do you wish to host a MCserver at home?
- Do you wish to rent a Virtual Private Server(VPS)?
- In order to choose you need to consider:
    - How much memory you need?
    - How much performance you need?
    - Is a VPS cheaper than if you count in the cost of buying a PC/server?
    - Do you need the server to run 24/7?
    - Do you have fast and reliable internet connection for running locally?
